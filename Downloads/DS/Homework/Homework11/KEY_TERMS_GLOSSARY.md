## Core Multi-Agent System Terms

### **Agent**

### **Multi-Agent System**
A system where multiple agents work together, each with specialized knowledge or perspectives, to solve complex problems.

### **Perspective**
A specific viewpoint or angle from which an agent analyzes a problem (e.g., technical, business, or lifestyle perspective).

## Chain-of-Debate Pattern Terms

### **Chain-of-Debate**
A pattern where multiple agents independently analyze a question from different perspectives, then a synthesis agent combines their viewpoints into a unified recommendation.

### **Debate Phase**
The stage where multiple agents provide their independent perspectives on the same question without seeing each other's responses.

### **Synthesis Phase**
The stage where a synthesis agent analyzes all perspectives and creates a unified, balanced recommendation.

### **Synthesis Agent**
A special agent that combines multiple perspectives into a single, coherent recommendation, considering all viewpoints.

### **Orchestrator**
A component that manages the flow of the Chain-of-Debate process, coordinating when agents should analyze and when synthesis should occur.

### **Parallel Processing**
When multiple agents work simultaneously on the same task, rather than one after another, to improve efficiency.

### **Independent Processing**
When agents work without seeing each other's responses, ensuring diverse and unbiased perspectives.

## CAP Theorem Terms

### **CAP Theorem**
A fundamental principle stating that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee 2 out of 3 properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

### **Consistency (C)**
The property that all nodes in a distributed system see the same data simultaneously - everyone has the same information at the same time.

### **Availability (A)**
The property that a system remains operational and can respond to requests, even if some components fail.

### **Partition Tolerance (P)**
The property that a system continues to function even when network communication between components fails or is delayed.

### **AP System**
A distributed system that prioritizes Availability and Partition Tolerance, accepting eventual consistency (our system's choice).

### **CP System**
A distributed system that prioritizes Consistency and Partition Tolerance, potentially sacrificing availability during network issues.

### **CA System**
A system prioritizing Consistency and Availability, but this is impossible in truly distributed systems due to network partitions.

### **Eventual Consistency**
A consistency model where the system will eventually become consistent, but not immediately - data may differ temporarily across nodes.

### **Strong Consistency**
A consistency model where all nodes always have the same data at the same time, requiring coordination and potentially slower responses.

### **Network Partition**
A situation where network communication between parts of a distributed system fails or is interrupted.

## Real-World Analogy

Think of the Chain-of-Debate system like a career counseling panel:

- **Agent** = A specialized counselor with expertise in one area (technical, business, or lifestyle)
- **Perspective** = Each counselor's unique viewpoint based on their expertise
- **Debate Phase** = Each counselor independently analyzes the question and provides their opinion
- **Synthesis Agent** = The head counselor who listens to all opinions and creates a unified recommendation
- **Orchestrator** = The coordinator who manages the panel discussion, ensuring everyone speaks and synthesis happens
- **Parallel Processing** = All counselors work on their analysis at the same time (faster than one-by-one)
- **CAP Theorem** = Like a panel that can prioritize: always being available to help (Availability), working even if one counselor is unavailable (Partition Tolerance), but accepting that counselors might have slightly different information (Eventual Consistency)

Think of CAP Theorem like a group project:

- **Consistency** = Everyone has the same information at the same time (requires constant communication)
- **Availability** = The group is always ready to work, even if one member is absent
- **Partition Tolerance** = The group can continue working even if communication breaks down
- **AP System** = Prioritize being available and working independently, accept that information might differ slightly until synthesis
